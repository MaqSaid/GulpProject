# PortfolioSite_GULP_SCSS_BOOTSTRAP
1) This is responsive website developed using HTML5,BOOTSTRAP,LESS, CSS,SASS,SCSS

2) This site was further optimised by using gulp (toolkit for automating painful or time-consuming tasks in my development workflow, 
so that I can stop messing around and build relevent website quickly!)

3) The code contains, installed Node Modules, and gulpfile.js files containing the tasks done on developed website
You may install the site on your local portal or run the pages directly on chrome from the actual folder 
( You could have the following folder file:///C:/ISAC-AU/index.html to directlty open in chrome)

4) Everytime you do any changes to your website, you need to run gulp in NPM.
